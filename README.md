# Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann

This repo is a copy of the updates-and-fixes branch of Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript Course for my personal use. Additionally, it contains some of my own code and notes for most sections of the course (but not all sections, since I skipped some of them).

You can find the original repo here: [complete-javascript-course](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course)

Also, you can take this course on Udemy: [The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)
